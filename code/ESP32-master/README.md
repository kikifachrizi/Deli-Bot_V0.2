# ESP32 Arduino sketch repository

These are sketches I have found to run on my own 1.4" x 0.7" ESP32 development board pictured below.

These are mostly for using I2C sensors with the ESP32 but I intend to make use of all of the peripherals of the ESP32 and I will post working sketches as I do so. The board is open source and the design can be found [here](https://www.oshpark.com/shared_projects/sHwYbfxM). Now you can buy this ESP32 Development Board on [Tindie](https://www.tindie.com/products/onehorse/esp32-development-board/).
